# Pairment Drupal 7 module
Add [Pairment's](http://pairment.com) accessibility testing to your Drupal website. This module adds a single permission called "View Pairment feedback" that you can add to any role. Then edit any HTML field (i.e. Body, or Content) and check the "Check field for accessibility with Pairment" checkbox.
